# KNN to predict Energy Consumption Efficiency Rating
- k-NN Classification of Energy Consumption Efficiency Rating with max power consumption, CO2 emissions per hour, annual energy cost dataset
- Jun. 24, 2020

### Final project for the ' AI for Non-major' Course
- The "energy consumption efficiency rating" system is designed to make it easier for consumers to purchase efficient energy-saving products.
Although it has been in effect for a long time now, few people are well aware of what criteria the grades are divided by. 
Therefore, we want to create a classifier that anyone can predict the rating.
